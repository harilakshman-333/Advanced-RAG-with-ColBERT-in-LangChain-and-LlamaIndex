# Advanced-RAG-with-ColBERT-in-LangChain-and-LlamaIndex
ColBERT is a fast and accurate retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds. This can be used as a potential alternative to Dense Embeddings in Retrieval Augmented Generation. In this video we explore using ColBERTv2 with RAGatouille and compare it with OpenAI Embedding models
